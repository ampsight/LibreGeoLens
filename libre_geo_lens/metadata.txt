description=Experiment with MLLMs to analyze remote sensing imagery
about=LibreGeoLens is an experimental QGIS plugin that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to analyze remote sensing imagery.

 It enables users to interactively explore local or remote georeferenced images, extract image chips, and engage in AI-assisted conversations about their content.

 The plugin provides tools to select, extract, and track image regions, maintaining a structured record of interactions in GeoJSON format.

 Whether you're a remote sensing analyst, geospatial researcher, or GIS enthusiast, LibreGeoLens empowers you to explore how to leverage frontier AI models for geospatial imagery directly within QGIS.

 This plugin has some prerequisites. Please go through https://github.com/ampsight/LibreGeoLens?tab=readme-ov-file#Prerequisites. After you install it, you might get an error about external Python dependencies. Try restarting QGIS and if that does not solve the issue, you'll need to install them manually by following https://github.com/ampsight/LibreGeoLens?tab=readme-ov-file#python-dependencies.
