description=Experiment with MLLMs to analyze remote sensing imagery
about=Chat with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) about the imagery you're seeing in QGIS. Stream Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGS), draw areas, and track interactions as GeoJSON features. This plugin has some prerequisites. Please go through https://github.com/ampsight/LibreGeoLens?tab=readme-ov-file#Prerequisites. After you install it, you might get an error about external Python dependencies. Try restarting QGIS and if that does not solve the issue, you'll need to install them manually by following https://github.com/ampsight/LibreGeoLens?tab=readme-ov-file#python-dependencies.
